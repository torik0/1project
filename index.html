    Porvoo is a city and a municipality situated on the southern coast of Finland approximately 50 kilometres (30 mi) east of Helsinki. It is one of the six medieval towns in Finland, first mentioned as a city in texts from the 14th century.

Porvoo is internationally considered to be one of the most beautiful towns in Finland.[6]
